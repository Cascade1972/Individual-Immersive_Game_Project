Unity 1: The sounds I used are: Ambient sound which is looping, sound for the teleport pad when the player steps on it (trigger), and a sound for the enemy.
Unity 2: I added a reverb zone to my teleport pad since it is inside and I feel the sound of teleporting would bounce off the walls. The second reverb I added was to my ambient sound
because my setting is supposed to be in a bee hive and those sounds would be reverbed from being inside a hive.
